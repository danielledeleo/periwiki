Welcome to your new wiki! This is the main page, and you can edit it to say whatever you want.

## Getting started

- **Edit this page** by clicking the "Edit" tab above
- **Create new articles** by visiting any URL like [[Example article]] and clicking the "Edit" tab to create the first revision
- **Link between articles** using `[[Article Name]]` wikilink syntax in your markdown
- Underscores in article URLs become spaces in titles: `My_Article` displays as "My Article"

## Syntax

Articles are written in Markdown with wiki extensions like `[[wikilinks]]`. See [[Periwiki:Syntax]] for the full reference.

## Administration

The first registered user is automatically an admin. Admins can manage users and settings from the sidebar.
