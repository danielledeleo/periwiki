Soon(ish)
- Make user pages, index, and other special pages all types of Articles (and revisions)
- Auto populate new databases with an Admin user with id 1 as the owner of all the default pages
- Create Markdown templates for default pages (index, user profiles, etc.)
- Automated tests 

Down the line
- Plugin system that uses Go's plugin package to allow .so files (that adhere to some sort of plugin Interface) to be loaded live
- There may be different classes of plugin, e.g. a simple lister widget, versus template file watcher/reloader, thus different interfaces
- I am not a robot
- rate limiting

Maybe
- file watcher for template files (maybe as a plugin?)

Learning
- practice more advanced templating techniques
